# ECO-348K
Causal Inference

This folder consists of all the work in the form of problem sets I've done in ECO 348K: Causal Inference.

So far, we have covered the following topics in the problem sets: 
* directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
* potential outcomes framework
* selection on observables
* randomization
* regression discontinuity design
* regression kink design
